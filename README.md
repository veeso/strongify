## Description

Probably something like that already existed but I wanted to keep it simple.

When I work on HTML/JSX pages I hate to have to type <strong>...</strong> around my text to make it bold. I wanted to have a simple way to make text bold without having to type the tags.

That's where strongify comes in.

Just select the text you want to wrap in the tags and press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `strongify` and press `Enter`.

project's logo is *cringy* on purpose

## Commands

There are two commands available:

- `Strongify: strong` - Wraps the selected text in `<strong>...</strong>` tags.
- `Strongify: italic` - Wraps the selected text in `<em>...</em>` tags.
